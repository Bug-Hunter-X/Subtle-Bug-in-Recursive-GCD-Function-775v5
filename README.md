# Subtle Bug in Recursive GCD Function
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function that aims to determine if two numbers are multiples of each other using a recursive approach to find their greatest common divisor (GCD). The bug is related to the handling of cases where the numbers' GCD is not 1. The original code incorrectly identifies some number pairs as multiples when they are not.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.
